# SQLCipherLib
SQLCipherLib is java binding library for supporting SQLCipher for xamarin android applications. From an Android N prespective we need to upgrade our .aar files to support 3.5.4. The current java binding is based on sqlcipher3.5.4.aar. The lib includes a sample which shows the db create statements and its initialization. sqlcipher demo shows how to consume the java libs using binding.
